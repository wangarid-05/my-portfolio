        <h2><h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Daisy Wangari, an interior designer with a keen eye for aesthetics and spatial harmony, now channeling that same creativity into the world of software engineering. With nearly three years of experience designing beautiful, functional spaces, I've developed a deep appreciation for structure, design thinking, and user-centered solutions skills that naturally translate into front-end development and problem-solving in tech. My journey into software engineering is fueled by a love for building, learning, and adapting. Just like designing a space, I enjoy crafting digital experiences that are both elegant and practical. I am currently expanding my knowledge in software engineering and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie at the intersection of design and technology.</p>
